# PromptKeeper Agent Vision

## Mission
To empower users with a private, local, and intelligent prompt management workspace directly within their browser. PromptKeeper transforms the browser from a passive consumption tool into an active, AI-assisted creation environment.

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Local & Private**: Your prompts are your intellectual property. They should never leave your device unless you choose to share them. All processing, storage, and AI optimization happens locally.
2.  **Frictionless Integration**: Management should happen where the work happens—in the browser input field.
3.  **AI-Augmented**: The tool shouldn't just store text; it should help you write better prompts using the latest on-device models (Gemini Nano).

## Strategic Direction
The project is evolving from a simple clipboard manager to a sophisticated **Prompt Engineering IDE**.

### Key Pillars
*   **Version Control**: Treat prompts like code. Track history, branch ideas, and revert changes.
*   **Optimization**: Use built-in AI to "Score" and "Refine" prompts based on industry best practices (Persona, Task, Context, Format).
*   **Organization**: Move beyond simple lists to structured libraries with tags and variables.

## User Persona
*   **The Power User**: Interacts with multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) daily.
*   **The Developer**: Needs to test prompt variations for applications.
*   **The Content Creator**: Maintains a library of style guides and recurring prompt structures.
