# Issue: Markdown Support in Prompt Editor

**Status**: Closed (Fixed in v2.1.0)
**Priority**: Medium
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Resolved**: 2025-12-29

## Description
Prompts generated by AI or written by users often contain Markdown formatting (bold, italics, lists, code blocks). Currently, the editor displays raw text. We need to render this Markdown visually in the editor for better readability.

 However, when the user clicks "Paste to Page" (to insert into ChatGPT/Claude), we likely want to option to stri down formatting to raw text? Or keep it?
 *User Request*: "when pasting into web pages, we can strip out the markdown formatting?"

## Requirements
1. **Rendering**:
   - [ ] Implement Markdown rendering in the main "Manage Prompts" editor (`options.html`).
   - [ ] Implement Markdown rendering in the Side Panel editor (`sidepanel.html`).
   - [ ] Support standard formatting: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, lists, `# Headers`, and code blocks.

2. **Editing**:
   - The editor should likely remain a text area (source view) or become a rich-text editor.
   - *Decision*: A "Preview Mode" or a "Live Preview" (split pane) might be safer than a full WYSIWYG editor to preserve the raw prompt structure.

3. **Paste Logic**:
   - [ ] Add a setting/toggle: "Strip Markdown on Paste".
   - [ ] If enabled, `**Persona**` becomes `Persona` when pasted into a target textarea.
   - [ ] If disabled, it pastes the raw markdown characters (default behavior today).

## Technical Implementation Plan
- Use a lightweight library like `marked` or `markdown-it` for rendering.
- For "Strip Markdown", use a utility to un-format the text before writing to clipboard/content script.
