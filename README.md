### Full-Screen IDE
Click **Manage Prompts** in the popup (or right-click → Options):
- **Left Sidebar**: Workspaces and prompt list.
- **Center**: Rich text editor with live word and character count.
- **Right Panel**: AI tools, editor options (including font size), and Google Drive settings. The panel is resizable and scrollable so nothing gets hidden.
- **Footer**: Version history selector, storage stats, and live `Words / Chars / Size` summary.

### Quick Popup & Side Panel
Click the extension icon for quick access:
- View and copy prompts instantly.
- **Paste to Page**: Insert prompts directly into ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
- Open the **Side Panel** for a compact version of the editor that shares the same font settings and AI tools. A single click on **Manage ↗** takes you into the full-screen IDE when you need more space.

## 🏗️ Architecture & How It's Built

PromptKeeper is designed around Chrome's cutting-edge **Built-in AI (Gemini Nano)**. By moving AI execution directly to the client side, we eliminate server round-trips, ensuring zero latency, offline capability, and total data privacy.

### Benefits of Chrome's Built-in AI Integration
Here's how PromptKeeper utilizes the [Chrome Prompt API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in) to deliver a superior developer experience:
- **Total Privacy (End-to-End Local Processing):** Your prompts, which often contain sensitive API keys or proprietary business logic, never leave your device.
- **Snappy User Experience:** Bypassing standard cloud inference delays lets our **Prompt Coach** score your inputs and suggest improvements in real-time as you type.
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Chrome's AI runtime dynamically optimizes inference using your machine's GPU/NPU for peak efficiency.

**Features Fully Powered by Gemini Nano in v2.2.0:**
* **Prompt Coach:** Real-time semantic analysis to score prompt strength.
* **Magic Enhance:** Fills in missing context and expands details.
* **Formalize & Clarify:** Rewrites prompts for a cleaner, professional tone.
* **Shorten:** Condenses long-winded logic into punchy instructions without losing meaning.
