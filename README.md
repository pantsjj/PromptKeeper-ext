## ✨ Key Features (v2.1)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📝 **Markdown Support** | Rich text preview with **bold**, *italics*, lists, and headers, plus **Click-to-Edit** previews. |
| ⌨️ **Shortcuts & Formatting** | Use `Cmd+B` and `Cmd+I` to format quickly. Raw markdown in the editor, clean text via stripped "Paste-to-Page". |
| 🧠 **Local AI (Gemini Nano)** | On-device optimization using Chrome’s Gemini Nano APIs. Includes **Magic Enhance**, **Formalize**, **Improve Clarity**, **Shorten**. AI meta-prompts avoid invented personas and clearly mark user-fill areas. |
| ⚡ **Streaming + Cancel AI** | Where supported, AI output streams into the editor progressively. Buttons switch to **Cancel** so you can abort long operations safely. |
| ⬇️ **Model Download Progress** | When Chrome is downloading/warming the on-device model, PromptKeeper surfaces a **Downloading…** progress indicator instead of failing silently. |
| ☁️ **Google Drive Sync** | Auto-backup to your private Drive. Access prompts on any device. |
| 🗂️ **Workspaces** | Organize prompts into Projects with drag-and-drop. |
| 📜 **Version History** | Every save is versioned. Time-travel to restore any version. |
| 🖥️ **Full-Screen IDE** | A spacious editor for serious prompt engineering with a resizable, scrollable right-hand options & AI panel. |
| 🔍 **Readable by Design** | Shared font-size controls keep the editor and markdown preview in sync across the full editor and side panel. |

## 📖 How It Works

`https://youtu.be/qIIJ2YItDPA`

### Full-Screen IDE
Click **Manage Prompts** in the popup (or right-click → Options):
- **Left Sidebar**: Workspaces and prompt list.
- **Center**: Rich text editor with live word and character count.
- **Right Panel**: AI tools, editor options (including font size), and Google Drive settings. The panel is resizable and scrollable so nothing gets hidden.
- **Footer**: Version history selector, storage stats, and live `Words / Chars / Size` summary.

### Quick Popup & Side Panel
Click the extension icon for quick access:
- View and copy prompts instantly.
- **Paste to Page**: Insert prompts directly into ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
- Open the **Side Panel** for a compact version of the editor that shares the same font settings and AI tools. A single click on **Manage ↗** takes you into the full-screen IDE when you need more space.
