WHAT'S NEW IN v2.1.1
• Streaming + Cancel AI: On supported Chrome builds, AI output can stream into the editor progressively. While running, buttons switch to "Cancel" so you can abort long operations.
• Model Download Progress: If Gemini Nano is warming up/downloading, PromptKeeper shows a "Downloading..." indicator when Chrome provides progress events.
• Local Model Stats: A compact "Local Model Stats" line shows token usage/quota (when available) under the editor.

WHAT'S NEW IN v2.1.0
• Markdown Support: Prompts now display as rich text (Bold, Lists, Headers). Click the text to edit instantly.
• Keyboard Shortcuts: Use Cmd+B and Cmd+I to format your prompts faster.
• Editor Tuning: Shared font-size controls for editor and preview, resizable right-hand panel, and improved side panel / full-editor flow.
• Safety & Autosave: Stronger AI prompting (no invented personas, clearer placeholders) plus optional auto-save and auto-save-on-switch so you don’t lose changes.

WHAT'S NEW IN v2.0.0
• Side Panel View: Browse, edit, and paste prompts directly into Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, ChatGPT and other tabs without leaving the page.  
• Full‑screen Prompt Management: A view for deep work, with live word count, AI tools, and Google Drive controls in the sidebar.  
• Workspaces & Projects: Group prompts by topic (Work, Creative, Coding, etc.), drag‑and‑drop between projects, and use right‑click context menus for smart deletion.  
• Google Drive Sync: Backup and restore your entire library (prompts + workspaces) to your Google Drive.  
• Version History: Every save creates a new revision; quickly time‑travel across the latest 50 changes per prompt.  
• Optional On‑device Gemini Nano: Refine prompts locally without API keys (where supported).

BUILT-IN AI OPTIMIZATION (Gemini Nano, on-device)
Leverage Chrome's on-device AI (when available) to refine your prompts without sending data anywhere.

## Privacy & Permissions (Copy/Paste for Dashboard)

Use these snippets to fill out the "Privacy practices" tab in the Developer Dashboard.

### Single Purpose Description
```text
PromptKeeper is a Generative AI prompt manager. It provides a single place to store, organize, version, and reuse prompts independently of any AI website, with optional Google Drive backup and side panel access while using tools like Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT.
```

### Permission Justification

#### storage
```text
The storage permission is crucial for PromptKeeper to save, retrieve, and manage users' writing prompts locally within the browser. This permission allows for efficient local storage (chrome.storage.local), enabling users to access and modify their data across browser sessions. It supports the extension's version control, import/export functionality, and overall prompt management system. The use of local storage establishes "Privacy First" data handling, ensuring user prompts never leave the device by default.
```

#### scripting
```text
The scripting permission is used to inject content scripts that enable the "Paste-to-Page" functionality and to interface with on-device AI APIs on supported pages. This allows the user to insert their managed prompts directly into text fields or active elements on third-party AI websites (like ChatGPT or Claude) with a single click.
```

#### tabs
```text
PromptKeeper uses the "tabs" permission (in conjunction with "activeTab") to identify the current tab context for the Side Panel and "Paste-to-Page" features. It allows the extension to route user actions to the correct active page. PromptKeeper does not access, read, or store the user's browsing history or open tab URLs.
```

#### identity
```text
PromptKeeper uses the "identity" permission exclusively to authenticate the user with their own Google account when they choose to enable Google Drive backup. The extension requests an OAuth token to read/write a single, dedicated backup file (promptkeeper_backup.json) in the user’s Google Drive. This token and the user's email are stored locally (chrome.storage.local) for UI display and re-authentication. No data is ever sent to a developer server.
```

#### alarms
```text
PromptKeeper uses the "alarms" permission to schedule optional automatic backups. When "Auto-backup" is enabled, an alarm triggers a background task every 30 minutes to sync changes to the user's dedicated backup file in Google Drive. If the feature is disabled, no alarms or background tasks run.
```

#### sidePanel
```text
PromptKeeper uses the "sidePanel" permission to provide a persistent, split-view interface. This allows users to browse their prompt library, edit text, and use "Paste-to-Page" actions without switching tabs or losing context in their main workspace (e.g., Google Docs or an AI chat).
```

### Host Permissions (<all_urls>) Justification
```text
PromptKeeper requests broad host permissions (<all_urls>) for two specific features:
1. Paste-to-Page: To allow users to insert prompts into any text field on any website they choose to visit (e.g., corporate intranets, new AI tools, or blog editors). Restricting this to a specific list would break the tool's core utility as a universal prompt manager.
2. On-Device AI Access: To inject a lightweight interface script that detects and communicates with the window.ai (Gemini Nano) API if exposed by the browser on the active page context.

Privacy Note: The content script is injected to be ready for these actions, but it does not scrape page content, track navigation, or transmit any data. It waits passively for a user-initiated command (like clicking "Paste") before interacting with the page.
```

### Remote Code
```text
No, I am not using Remote code.
```
